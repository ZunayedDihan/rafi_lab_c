Question 1: (Sum and Print)

Given a range [a, b], you are to find the summation of all the odd integers in this range. For example, the summation of all the odd integers in the range [3, 9] is 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24.

Input 
There can be at multiple test cases. The first line of input gives you the number of test cases, T (1≤T≤100). Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of 2 integers a and b (0≤a≤b≤100) in two separate lines.

Output 
For each test case you are to print one line of output - the serial number of the test case followed by the summation of the odd integers in the range [a, b].

Sample Input 
2
1
5
3
5
Sample Output 
Case 1: 9
Case 2: 8

Question 2: (Remove Duplicate Numbers )

Petya has an array a consisting of n integers. He wants to remove duplicate (equal) elements.

Petya wants to leave only the rightmost entry (occurrence) for each element of the array. The relative order of the remaining unique elements should not be changed.

Input
The first line contains a single integer n (1≤n≤50) — the number of elements in Petya's array.

The following line contains a sequence a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1000) — the Petya's array.

Output
In the first line print integer x — the number of elements which will be left in Petya's array after he removed the duplicates.

In the second line print x integers separated with a space — Petya's array after he removed the duplicates. For each unique element only the rightmost entry should be left.

Examples
Input
6
1 5 5 1 6 1
Output
3
5 6 1 
Input
5
2 4 2 4 4
Output
2
2 4 
Input
5
6 6 6 6 6
Output
1
6 
Note
In the first example you should remove two integers 1, which are in the positions 1 and 4. Also you should remove the integer 5, which is in the position 2.

In the second example you should remove integer 2, which is in the position 1, and two integers 4, which are in the positions 2 and 4.

In the third example you should remove four integers 6, which are in the positions 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Question 3: (C - Print String)

Sakib Al Hasan is given a string t consisting of n lowercase letters and an integer number k.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. Let's think of some substring of a string s with indices from l to r as s[l…r].

Your task is to help Sakib Al Hasan constructing such string s of minimum possible length that there are exactly k positions i such that s[i…i+n−1]=t. In other words, your task is to construct such string s of minimum possible length that there are exactly k substrings of s equal to t.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1≤n,k≤50) — the length of Sakib Al Hasan's string t and the number of substrings.

The second line of the input contains Sakib Al Hasan's string t consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
Output
Print such string s of minimum possible length that there are exactly k substrings of s equal to t.

It is guaranteed that the answer is always unique.
Examples
Input 1
3 4
aba
Output 1
ababababa
Input 2
3 2
cat
Output 2
catcat

Question 5: (Maximum Corresponding Value)

You are given an array A[1], A[2], ..., A[N] . ( |A[i]| ≤ 15009 , 1 ≤ N ≤ 50007 ). A function is defined as follows:
CorrespondingMax(x,y) = Max { a[i]+a[i+1]+...+a[j] ; x ≤ i ≤ j ≤ y }.
Given M queries, your program must output the results of this function for these queries.

Input
The first line of the input file contains the integer N.
In the second line, N numbers follow.
The third line contains the integer M.
M lines follow, where line i contains 2 numbers xi and yi.
Output
Your program should output the results of the M queries, one query per line.

Example
Input:
3 
-1 2 3
1
1 2

Output:
2
